An accelerated economic game.

## About Bancor3D

The bancor was a supranational currency that John Maynard Keynes and E. F. Schumacher[1] conceptualised in the years 1940–1942 and which the United Kingdom proposed to introduce after World War II. The name was inspired by the French banque or ('bank gold'). This newly created supranational currency would then be used in international trade as a unit of account within a multilateral clearing system—the International Clearing Union—which would also have to be founded. 
In 2018, we project the bancor into reality. Here we compress the time and quickly test the game under the Bancor pricing model. We set up a prize pool which called Keynes's reward for the winner of the game.

## Allocation

In Bancor3D, the EOS that purchased the Key will be allocated as follows:
50% entered the free market and adjusted the pricing using the Bancor agreement;
36% deposited in Keynes' Reward;
10% is used to invite rewards;
4% is used for development operations.

## Accelerated Bancor

Is the pricing model of Bancor consistent with the market-based results? And what happens if there is an inconsistency? For decades, many economists have only analyzed in theory but not conducted simulation experiments. In Bancor3D, we will experiment to verify this.

Our team conducted an in-depth analysis of historical price changes since the generation of digital currency and adjusted the price function. This adjustment will speed up the time within the Bancor3D system to quickly verify the pros and cons of Bancor and market-based pricing.

In order to prevent the manipulation of prices and other behaviors that affect the experimental results, we will not disclose the pricing function. One thing that can be confirmed is that increase in the price of Key are accelerating as time goes by and more KEYs get purchased. You are welcome to guess the pricing model. For economists who guess the price model, the team will send a special gift. You can send your guess to muggles@bancor3d.com


## Keynes' Reward

36% of income of sales of key will be stored in the Keynes' Reward. When the player sells the key, half of the player's cost which was stored in the Keynes' Reward will enter the bonus pool. It will be distributed to the players who is HODLING keys.

The initial countdown of the game is 7 days. Each purchase of a Key extends the game time by 30 seconds, and the extension time is uppper bounded by 7 days. When the countdown ends, all EOS in the prize pool will be awarded to players who have bought in the last 10 minutes. Each player will be rewarded for the percentage of Keys they bought in the last ten minutes.
Unfortunately, the probability of a hacker's exclusive pool is greatly reduced.


## Referral

Everyone who gets more people involved in this game will be rewarded. 10% of EOS will be used for referral rewards. First level inviters and second level inviters will receive a reward of 8% and 2% seperately.
